Animals in Distress Website

This project is a responsive website designed for the non-profit organisation Animals in Distress. The website provides information about the organisation, its services, adoption opportunities, and how supporters can get in touch or donate.
It was created as part of a UI/UX design portfolio project and follows key principles of accessibility, responsiveness, and clean navigation.
